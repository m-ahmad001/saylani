    <p>Assalam-o-Alaikum</p>

      Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for
      him many times over? ( Surat Baqara, Verse 245) <br />
      <br />
      It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing,
      instills upon his men to give Qarz-e-Hasana because it is in man’s nature
      to be frugal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about qarz because
      it is returned and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by
      70 folds. Allah conveys his message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy
      Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend their wealth in a certain way.
      He says,Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth. If you do so, no
      fire, flood or thieves will be able to rob you off your money. Instead,
      you will be endowed with your wealth when you most need it. He further
      says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to
      the negligence of the rich, who should not be stingy in spending their
      money on those worse off than themselves. Allah will not only take strict
      accountability from those people but He will also punish them accordingly.
      On the Day Of Judgement, the rich will be humiliated because they did not
      help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah and say that all those
      men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence
      in its proper use; they were busy spending on themselves and forgot about
      us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply to this and say: “I swear on
      my respect and glory! I will bring you closer to me and push them further
      away.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Alhamdollilah, Allah has accorded Saylani Welfare with the highest favor
      by sending those people our way who follow the teachings of the Holy Quran
      and Hadith, give zakat, fidyah, fitrah, khairat and other donations to
      help us help those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is
      so that you not only spread this message to others but also play your part
      in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy till the Day of
      Judgment.
